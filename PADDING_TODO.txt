TODO sketch for this branch, in rough priority order:

- Update proposal
-- Switch from sending state machines to requesting a "menu option" of state
   machine.

- Clean up/fix XXX's and FIXMEs
  - Bin sampling issues wrt infinity bin and beyond..
    - May need better tests first, to check for breakage
  - Comb over uint64 vs uint32 vs other int usage. Clarify units
  - Better assert/BUG usage
  - Misc XXX's
  - Add tests for dists, length and iat sampling
  - Add tests for detecting padding from wrong hop
  - Add tests for machine replacement
  - Better test coverage in general

- Rephist timer stats
  - Is this a privacy risk? The adversary could create lots of circuits
    to find a layer2 vanguard.. Otherwise they will be spread across middles.

- Determine good hardcoded/example histograms

- Specify target circuit lifetime?

- Specify ports for machine??

- Support torrc load+serialization of state machines
  - ??

- Support consensus load+serialization of state machines
  - ??

======== 0.3.6 ========

- Come up with some good histograms for eg circuit setup fingerprinting,
  website fingerprinting, and vanguards usage.
- Experiment with run-length histograms and other histogram/distribution
  encoding methods.

TODO sketch for this branch, in rough priority order:

- Update proposal
-- Switch from sending state machines to requesting a "menu option" of state
   machine.

- Clean up/fix XXX's and FIXMEs
  - Different termination condition instead of Infinity bin?
  - Generic start state code
    - Start state vs negotiate
  - Rephist timer stats
  - Add tests for detecting padding from wrong hop
  - Add tests for machine replacement
  - Better test coverage in general

- Determine good hardcoded/example histograms

- Specify target circuit lifetime?

- Specify ports for machine??

- Support torrc load+serialization of state machines
  - ??

- Support consensus load+serialization of state machines
  - ??

======== 0.3.6 ========

- Come up with some good histograms for eg circuit setup fingerprinting,
  website fingerprinting, and vanguards usage.
- Experiment with run-length histograms and other histogram/distribution
  encoding methods.

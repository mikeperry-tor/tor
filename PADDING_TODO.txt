TODO sketch for this branch, in rough priority order:

- Update proposal
-- Switch from sending state machines to requesting a "menu option" of state
   machine.

- Clean up/fix XXX's and FIXMEs
  - Fix dup event callback from code review, verify sane event call-in
    placement (ie vs circuitmux or other places from #25505)
  - Check token removal: Should only remove toks on "send" events, not recv
  - Verify we're scheduling new padding in sane places
  - Verify event ordering for events that the padding code emits to itself
    (such as bins empty, padding sent, infinity, etc)
  - machine setup events
    - Support multiple WTF-PAD machines per circuit
  - Generic start state code
  - Add tests for detecting padding from wrong hop
  - Better test coverage in general
  - Rephist timer stats

- Determine good hardcoded/example histograms

- Allow padding on specific circuit purposes
  - 2 weeks

- Allow padding events to start/stop padding based on circuit
  construction state and stream usage and target circuit lifetime
  - 1 week

- Different termination condition instead of Infinity bin?

- Support torrc load+serialization of state machines
  - ??

- Support consensus load+serialization of state machines
  - ??

======== 0.3.6 ========

- Come up with some good histograms for eg circuit setup fingerprinting,
  website fingerprinting, and vanguards usage.
- Experiment with run-length histograms and other histogram/distribution
  encoding methods.

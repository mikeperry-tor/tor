Code issues:
 - file libevent timer resolution bug, link it in doc
 - file timer flag bug
 - File + fix RIT bug
 - Link RIT machines in doc
 - Document intiuition behind state machines. Mention ANY_BIN_EMPTY event,
   others
 - Link to simulator docs; update sections saying it needs to be implemented
 - asn's analysis + bug filing
 - Triage other bugs

sim issues:
 - If this branch is used with a middle node that does *not* run the branch
   or support logging, then there is an extra error response cell from the
   relay
   - Document this, or filter it out? Hrmm...
   - We could add logic to the C side to not negotiate logging if
     MiddleNodes torrc option is not set...
 - extractor must specify circid (or ids?)
   - Document that simulator can use only one circ at a time
   - To study multiplexing effects, must split and merge after
     - Script for this?
 - negotiate event logging + simulator handling
   - Simulator no longer needs an option to strip negotiate cells!
     - regular machine negotiate events are gone
     - Always strip circpad_negotiate_logging events; see commit message
 - Warn about trusting time in simulator docs/output
   - Cite libevent bug/circpad doc section from above TODO, when its done
 - Add in extra synthetic non-padding cell on relay side, before
   circpad_negotiate_logging event?
   - This is to record the onionskin the relay got to start its circuit view..
   - Use the calculated RTT delta for this? Should be one full RTT before
     circpad_negotiate_logging

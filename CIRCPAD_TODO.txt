Code issues:
 - file libevent timer resolution bug, link it in doc
 - file timer flag bug
 - File + fix RIT bug
 - Link RIT machines in doc
 - Document intiuition behind state machines. Mention ANY_BIN_EMPTY event,
   others
 - Link to simulator docs; update sections saying it needs to be implemented
 - asn's analysis + bug filing
 - Triage other bugs

sim issues:
 - extractor must specify circid (or ids?)
   - Document that simulator can use only one circ at a time; must split+merge after
 - negotiate event logging + simulator handling
   - Remove custom event codepaths for negotiate in simulator
   - Simulator no longer needs an option to strip negotiate cells!
     - Should always strip circpad_negotiate_logging events, though
 - Warn about trusting time in simulator docs/output
   - Cite libevent bug/circpad doc section from above TODO, when its done

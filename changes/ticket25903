  o Minor features (control port):
    - Introduce new fields to the CIRC_BW event. There are two new fields
      in each of the read and written directions. The DELIVERED fields
      report the total valid application data on the circuit, as measured
      by valid RELAY_COMMAND_DATA payload sizes, and the OVERHEAD fields
      report the unused bytes in each RELAY_COMMAND_DATA cell. Closes ticket
      25903.

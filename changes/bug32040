  o Minor bugfixes (circuitpadding):
    - Add the abilility to keep circuit padding machines if they match a set
      of circuit state or purposes. This allows us to have machines that start
      up under some conditions but don't shut down under others. Part of fix
      for bug 32040; bugfix on 0.4.1.1-alpha.

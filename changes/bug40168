  o Minor bugfixes (circuit build timeout):
    - Use a full maximum likelihood estimator for Pareto parameters of the
      timeout distribution, instead of a "right-censored estimator". This
      change causes us to completely ignore circuits that never finish building
      in our timeout calculations. Previously, we were counting such unfinished
      circuits as having the highest possible timeout value, when in reality
      these circuits most likely just contain relays that are offline.
      Additionally, we now wait a bit longer to let circuits complete for
      measurement purposes, lower the minimum possible effective timeout from
      1.5 seconds to 10ms, and increase the resolution of the circuit build
      time histrogram from 50ms bin widths to 10ms bin widths.
      Fixes bug 40168; bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha.
